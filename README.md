**Introduction:**  
This code shows a sample of using the Visual Studio IDE to create a dynamic link library (DLL) written in Microsoft C++ (MSVC), and then using the DLL from another C++ app. In this code, a DLL is created that implements some math functions. Then a console app that uses the functions from the DLL is created.
  
**This code covers these tasks:**
1. Create a DLL project in Visual Studio.
2. Add exported functions and variables to the DLL.
3. Create a console app project in Visual Studio.
4. Use the functions and variables imported from the DLL in the console app.
5. Run the completed app.
  
**Platform:** Windows 10 x64.  
**IDE:** Visual Studio 2015.  
**Configuration:** Debug mode.

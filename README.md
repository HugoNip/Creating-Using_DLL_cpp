This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to use the Visual Studio IDE to create your own dynamic link library (DLL) written in Microsoft C++ (MSVC). Then it shows how to use the DLL from another C++ app. 

In this walkthrough, a DLL is created that implements some math functions. Then a console app that uses the functions from the DLL is created.


This walkthrough covers these tasks:

1. Create a DLL project in Visual Studio.
2. Add exported functions and variables to the DLL.
3. Create a console app project in Visual Studio.
4. Use the functions and variables imported from the DLL in the console app.
5. Run the completed app.
